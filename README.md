## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

All the necessary libraries to run the code were already available in Anaconda distribution of Python. This script was written using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, my intention was to better undestand motivations and/or possible correlations affecting customer churn's rate, along with the creation of a predictive model capable of identifying whether a client is likely to cancel its relationship with the company or not.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1. Notebooks - Jupyter Notebook in Portuguese version with the script developed for creating the predictive model.
2. Csv files - a copy of the .csv files used in the project, containing separated train and test data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The results are communicated in the notebook cells annotating insights and process decisions.
